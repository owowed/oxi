# Contributing Guidelines & Documentation

## General Rules

- Fork and create pull request before committing into the `master` branch.

## Branch

- `master` - the main branch for the repository.
- `package` - contains the lastest commits from `master` and `dist` files.
    - Auto-generated. Do not make commit or change into this branch.
- `dist` - contains the latest release `dist` files on the top level.
    - Auto-generated. Do not make commit or change into this branch.

## Commit Message Format

We follow strictly to [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for our commit message format.

We also recommend [Angular's Commit Message Format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format) and its other conventions for some area.

## Release

- In order to make release, select the current draft release document generated by release-drafter, and edit the document if needed.

- Always select `package` branch target for the release tag. The `package` branch contains the latest commits and files from `master` and the latest `dist` files automatically generated, which `master` doesn't have.

- Pull request merge commits are automatically tracked by release-drafter and written into the latest release draft.
